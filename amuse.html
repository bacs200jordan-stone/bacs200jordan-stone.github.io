    <h1>Amusing Stuff!</h1>
    <h3>by Jordan Stone</h3>
    <p>The internet is a very interesting and funny place.  This page contains some funny things that make me laugh or that brings me happieness.</p>

    <h2>Somewhere I Spend Hours On...</h2>
    <p>I love reading peoples Reddit posts. I find them so amusing. I like reading all types of stories but my favorite is the AITA sub-Reddit. It has the craziest stroies on there that make my mouth drop sometimes. If you are ever bored, I recommened this!</p>

    <h2>Something I will always laugh at</h2>
    <p>Impractical Jokers is one of my favorite shows. I used to watch it with my dad all the time. This show will always make me laugh, so sometimes I will just watch a little 5 minute clip if I need a laugh.</p>

    <h2>Something I love</h2>
    <p>This is not a funny website but I enjoy looking at cute dogs. I am a huge dog person so this brings me joy. I have a 2 year old mixed breed dog that I adopted January of 2021 and he just makes me happy and so does seeing other dogs!<p>
